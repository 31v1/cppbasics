🧊🐻 Why a Story?
--

Traditional beginner programming exercises tend to be functional… and painfully dull.
After a few hours of typing numbers into a console, even the hardiest trainee at the Polar Aerospace Operations Base starts questioning their life choices.

**Do not be misled by the playful tone: the exercises are as challenging as any textbook example. The story exists only to make the process less monotonous — not easier.**

So this module uses a light narrative — a polar bear cosmonaut, a silent seal, a plush with suspiciously expressive whiskers, and a remote industrial facility where professionalism remains absolute even when the operators have paws.

The story doesn’t replace the technical content.
It simply makes the process more bearable.

Because when you’re learning C++ and trying to stay awake through loops, conditionals and battling = and ==, a little humor is as essential as thermal gloves.

## Polar Aerospace Operations Base — Technical Training Module I

Before joining the main operations team at the Polar Aerospace Operations Base, every trainee — including the now‑renowned polar bear cosmonaut Belyy Ursov — must complete a foundational programming module.

This first stage focuses on the core building blocks of C++ needed to operate and monitor basic systems within the facility.
The tone is intentionally straightforward and industrial, with a subtle hint of dry humor acknowledging the unusual but highly professional nature of the personnel.
This module introduces Belyy Ursov, a trained polar bear cosmonaut beginning her technical preparation.
The exercises simulate simple tasks performed during early training at the Polar Aerospace Operations Base — a remote, highly specialized facility where professionalism remains constant, even if the operators have paws.

## 🧊🐻 Exercises Overview
1. Welcome Message
Display a greeting for the cosmonaut beginning their shift.

2. Serial Number Check
Determine whether a component’s serial number is even or odd.

3. Oven Temperature Alert
Evaluate a temperature reading and warn if it exceeds a threshold.

4. Conveyor Belt Speed Monitor
Use multiple conditions to classify speed levels.

5. Weight Comparison
Compare two values and report which is heavier.

6. Basic Counter (while loop)
Count upward from 1 to a target number.

7. Input Validation (do‑while)
Request a number within a specific range until the user provides a valid one.

8. Repeated Message
Print a message a specified number of times using a for loop.

9. Machine Startup Counter
Count from 1 to a user‑defined target using a for loop.

10. Polar Operations Check
Integrate all basic concepts to classify readings until a sentinel value is entered.

## 🧊🐻 Concepts Practiced
