# cppbasics
A collection of introductory C++ exercises covering essential programming concepts such as input/output, conditionals, loops, and basic validation.

## Polar Aerospace Operations Base — Technical Training Module I

Before joining the main operations team at the Polar Aerospace Operations Base, every trainee — including the now‑renowned polar bear cosmonaut Belyy Ursov — must complete a foundational programming module.

This first stage focuses on the core building blocks of C++ needed to operate and monitor basic systems within the facility.
The tone is intentionally straightforward and industrial, with a subtle hint of dry humor acknowledging the unusual but highly professional nature of the personnel.

## 🧊🐻 Objectives of the Module

By the end of cppbasic, the trainee will be able to:

Display information using console output

Read and validate user input

Use conditional logic (if, else if, else)

Implement repetition with while, do‑while, and for loops

Perform simple comparisons and numeric checks

Build small, self‑contained programs that simulate basic operational tasks

These exercises mirror the logic commonly used in technical interviews — the polar‑cosmonaut theme is simply a narrative wrapper.

## 🧊🐻 Exercises Overview
1. Welcome Message
Display a greeting for the cosmonaut beginning their shift.

2. Serial Number Check
Determine whether a component’s serial number is even or odd.

3. Oven Temperature Alert
Evaluate a temperature reading and warn if it exceeds a threshold.

4. Conveyor Belt Speed Monitor
Use multiple conditions to classify speed levels.

5. Weight Comparison
Compare two values and report which is heavier.

6. Basic Counter (while loop)
Count upward from 1 to a target number.

7. Input Validation (do‑while)
Request a number within a specific range until the user provides a valid one.

8. Repeated Message
Print a message a specified number of times using a for loop.

9. Machine Startup Counter
Count from 1 to a user‑defined target using a for loop.

10. Final Input Review
Integrate all basic concepts to classify readings until a sentinel value is entered.

## 🧊🐻 Concepts Practiced

Console input/output

Conditionals

Loops (while, do‑while, for)

Validation

Basic arithmetic

Incrementing counters

Sentinel‑controlled repetition

## 🧊🐻 Narrative Continuity

This module introduces Belyy Ursov, a trained polar bear cosmonaut beginning her technical preparation.
The exercises simulate simple tasks performed during early training at the Polar Aerospace Operations Base — a remote, highly specialized facility where professionalism remains constant, even if the operators have paws.
