# Hello, Control Center  

Every system at the Polar Aerospace Operations Base starts by sending a simple greeting to the Control Center.
It’s the smallest possible confirmation that the machine is awake, responsive, and not frozen solid.

## 🎯 Objective
Print a custom welcome message from the system.

## 🧊🐻 Narrative Context
This is the first task assigned to new trainees — including Belyy Ursov during her onboarding week.
If the system can say hello, everything else can follow.

## 💡 Concepts Practiced
Basic console output (cout)
Program structure
First C++ program
