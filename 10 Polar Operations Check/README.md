## Polar Operations Check
In a remote cold‑region facility, a trained polar bear operates basic industrial equipment.
Before ending the shift, the operator performs a routine review of several numeric readings.
Each reading is evaluated immediately, and the process continues until the operator enters 0, which ends the review.

For every value entered:

If the number is even, display: “OK – even reading”

If the number is odd, display: “Attention – odd reading”

If the number is negative, display: “Invalid reading – negative value” (and ignore it)

When the operator enters 0, display a closing message indicating that the polar bear has completed the review and the system is ready for shutdown.
