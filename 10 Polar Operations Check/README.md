## Polar Operations Check
In the remote Arctic sector, the Polar Aerospace Operations Base conducts routine end‑of‑shift reviews to ensure all equipment remains stable under extreme conditions.
The operator — a trained polar bear cosmonaut now assigned to ground‑level machinery supervision — must evaluate a sequence of numeric readings.
The review continues until the operator enters 0, which signals the end of the procedure.

🧊 Task
For each reading entered:

If the value is even, display:
OK – even reading

If the value is odd, display:
Attention – odd reading

If the value is negative, display:
Invalid reading – negative value  
(and ignore it)

When the operator enters 0, display a closing message indicating that the polar cosmonaut has completed the review and the system is ready for shutdown.
