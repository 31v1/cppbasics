## Input Validator

## 🧊🐻 Overview
In the access terminals of the Polar Aerospace Operations Base, operators must enter valid codes before proceeding.  
The system repeatedly checks the input to ensure it falls within the expected range.

## 🎯 Objective
- Ask the operator for a number between 1 and 5  
- If the number is outside this range, request it again  
- Use a do-while loop to enforce the validation  

## 🧊🐻 Narrative Context
Trainees quickly learn that entering “creative numbers” is not appreciated by the Control Center.  
Belyy Ursov once tried entering 0 “just to see what happens.”  
The system asked again. And again. And again.

## 💡 Concepts Practiced
- Input handling (`cin`)
- Basic validation
- Repetition with `do-while`
