# Repeated Message

## 🧊🐻 Overview
In the communications wing of the Polar Aerospace Operations Base, operators often need to broadcast short status messages multiple times for logging or redundancy.  
This routine prints a message repeatedly based on the operator’s input.

## 🎯 Objective
- Ask the operator how many times the message should be displayed  
- Print the message exactly that many times  
- Use a for loop to control the repetition  

## 🧊🐻 Narrative Context
During training, Belyy Ursov once set the repetition count to 200 “just to test durability.”  
The console passed the test.  
The operator’s patience did not.

## 💡 Concepts Practiced
- Input handling (`cin`)
- Controlled repetition (`for`)
- Basic counters
