# Speed Limit Monitor

## 🧊 Overview
In the logistics wing of the Polar Aerospace Operations Base, conveyor belts move equipment, samples, and the occasional plush unit.
To keep operations safe, the system performs a quick speed check and alerts the operator if the belt is running too fast or too slow.

## 🎯 Objective
Read the conveyor belt’s current speed

Warn if the speed is above 80

Warn if the speed is below 30

Otherwise, report that the speed is normal

## 🧊🐻 Narrative Context
New trainees quickly learn that overspeed means “things will start flying,” and underspeed means “nothing will arrive on time.”
Belyy Ursov prefers the normal range — fewer surprises, fewer airborne tools.

## 💡 Concepts Practiced
* Input handling (cin)

* Conditional logic (if, else if, else)

* Range checking
