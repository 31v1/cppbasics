# Counter Display

## Overview
In the monitoring wing of the Polar Aerospace Operations Base, operators often need to verify that counting systems are functioning correctly.
This routine displays a sequence of numbers to confirm that the counter increments as expected.

## Objective
- Ask the operator for a positive number
- Display all numbers from 1 up to that number
- Use a while loop to perform the repetition

## Narrative Context
During her early training, Belyy Ursov used this counter test to ensure the console hadn’t frozen overnight — a common issue when the room temperature matches the outside tundra.

## Concepts Practiced
- Input handling (`cin`)
- Basic repetition (`while`)
- Incrementing counters
