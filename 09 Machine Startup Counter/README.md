# Machine Startup Counter

## 🧊🐻 Overview
In the production wing of the Polar Aerospace Operations Base, machines begin their startup sequence by running a simple ascending count.  
This confirms that the system’s timing and output routines are functioning correctly.

## 🎯 Objective
- Ask the operator for a target number  
- Count from 1 up to that number  
- Display each step of the startup sequence on the console  
- Use a for loop to control the progression  

## 🧊🐻 Narrative Context
During her first week, Belyy Ursov found this sequence oddly satisfying — a small ritual before the machinery roared to life.  
Engineering insists it’s “diagnostic,” but she calls it “a polite warm‑up.”

## 💡 Concepts Practiced
- For loop  
- Incrementing counters  
- Console output
