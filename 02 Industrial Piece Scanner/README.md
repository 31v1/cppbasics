# Industrial Piece Scanner  

## 🧊 Overview
On the assembly line at the Polar Aerospace Operations Base, each component passes through an automated scanner.
The system performs a quick parity check to decide whether the piece continues down the line or gets diverted for inspection.

## 🎯 Objective
Read a serial number from the console

Accept the piece if the number is even

Reject it if the number is odd

## 🧊🐻 Narrative Context
This is one of the first real tasks assigned to trainees.
Belyy Ursov learned quickly that odd‑numbered parts usually come from “creative suppliers,” and the scanner’s judgment is often wiser than hers.

## 💡 Concepts Practiced
* Input handling (cin)
* Conditional logic (if)
* Even/odd evaluation using modulo
