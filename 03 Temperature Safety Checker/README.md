# Temperature Safety Checker

## 🧊 Overview
In the thermal wing of the Polar Aerospace Operations Base, ovens run nonstop to process materials that definitely shouldn’t be touched with bare paws.
The system performs a quick temperature check to ensure nothing is overheating.

## 🎯 Objective
* Read the oven’s current temperature
* Warn the operator if it is 100 or higher
* Otherwise, report that conditions are safe

## 🧊🐻 Narrative Context
Trainees learn early that “safe temperature” is a flexible term in the Arctic, but the Control Center insists on clear thresholds.
Belyy Ursov once described 100 degrees as “warm,” but engineering politely disagreed.

## 💡 Concepts Practiced
* Input handling (cin)
* Conditional logic (if)
* Comparison operators (>=)
