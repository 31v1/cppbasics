# Weight Comparator

## 🧊 Overview
In the storage wing of the Polar Aerospace Operations Base, components arrive in pairs that must be sorted by weight.
The system performs a quick comparison to determine which piece is heavier — or whether both weigh the same.

## 🎯 Objective
Read the weight of two pieces

Report which one is heavier

If they are equal, indicate that they weigh the same

## 🧊🐻 Narrative Context
Trainees quickly learn that “just eyeballing it” is not an approved method, especially when dealing with dense alloy blocks.
Belyy Ursov once tried lifting both pieces herself; engineering strongly recommended using the comparator instead.

## 💡 Concepts Practiced
* Input handling (cin)

* Conditional logic (if, else if, else)

* Value comparison
